## Introduction

A few months ago I decided to preorder a [Wyze Band](https://wyze.com/wyze-band).
It was only $25 and I was curious to have a smart watch
that could monitor my heart rate.

Here's the summary:

⭐⭐⭐⭐

I give it 4/5 stars, primarily for being such a good value.

### The Good

---

- Cheap
- Insane battery life
- Great screen
- Comfortable
- Fairly customizable
- Waterproof
- Has a vibration feedback
- A lot of features for the price
- Find my phone (or vice versa) feature

### The Bad

---

- Wyze app needs to be constantly running
- Notifications are inconsistent
- No external fitness app integration (coming soon, supposedly)

### The Ugly

---

- Alexa integration is relatively useless
- While waterproof, water hitting the screen triggers presses, which is incredibly obnoxious

## Detailed Review

To start with, I really like this thing. It does so much well, for only $25.
I guess the best way to describe this product is that it's primarily a fitness tracker
with some smart watch capabilities.

### What You Get

Inside the box, you get the band itself, and a USB charger that is very reminiscent
of a FitBit.

![Wyze Band box and charger](img/in-the-box.jpg "Wyze Band box and charger")

The Wyze Band comes with a hole-punch style band. The other side has a little peg
which holds it in place firmly. As I pre-ordered the band,
I also received an additional more traditional watch style
band. I haven't put this on, as it has moving pieces and seems more fragile, and
I like the basic band just fine.

![Both bands side by side to show differences](img/band-comparison.jpg "The watch style band is on top, and the hole-punch band is attached to the Band on the bottom")

The front Band itself has a small touchscreen full-color AMOLED display
(which looks fantastic) and a single illuminated button below it.
This button acts as a pseudo home and back button.
Pressing and holding this button triggers Amazon Alexa.

![Front of the Wyze Band](img/band-front.jpg "Front of the Band")

The back side of the Band has the two charging contacts, the heart rate sensor, and
an etched Wyze logo.

![Back of the Wyze Band](img/band-back.jpg "Back of the Band")

The right side of the Band features two holes for the microphones for Alexa.

![Right side of the Wyze Band](img/band-right.jpg "Right side of the Band")

The left side does not have any openings.

### Setup

For starters, you absolutely need
a phone with the Wyze app installed. The Band is completely dependent on it.
While it doesn't _need_ to be running at all times, if you actually want
notifications to work, Alexa, or weather to update, you have to set it up to
constantly run in the background.

### Screens

Once you get the Band setup, the Band has multiple different
screens you can swipe through.

{{< video src="vid/swipe.mp4" alt="Swiping through screen demonstration" caption="Swipe up, swipe down, swipe it all around." >}}

The screens can be reordered or removed<sup>\*</sup> as desired. Each screen
also has accompanying information in the Wyze app.

In the following screenshots, the image on the left is how the screen appears on the
Band, and the right is what options there are in the Wyze app.
In no particular order, the screen available are:

#### Watch Face

The watch face is the only screen that you cannot reorder. It can also not be removed.
You can select from six different colors, 5 different layouts, and seven included
background images. You can also import your own background image.

![The watch face on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/watch-face-app.jpg)

I really don't like the included images. All of the layouts have text that overlap
items in the images, making the text harder to read. The image with the colored
bars I have selected has the most black space on the top and bottom of all of them.

I also dislike how only a single layout even shows the current number of steps for the
day. I feel like that's a really nice feature to have and some of the other layouts
have plenty of space to add it.

#### Heart Rate

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen will immediately measure your heart rate
and give a live display.

In the app, this page shows heart rate graphs and you
can configure how often heart rate is collected.

![The heart rate screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/heart-rate-app.jpg "The heart rate screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

This is quite fun, and works well. I enjoy seeing how much my heart rate
goes up just playing a tense horror game, or a stressful board game.

#### Activity

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen will show small graphs for the day
of steps, heart rate, and sleep tracking.

![The activity graphs on the Band](img/activity-band.jpg "The activity graphs on the Band")

In the app, this page shows the same graphs, but for more periods of time.

![The activity screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/activity-app.jpg "The activity screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

My only complaint here is that this is the Wyze app is the _only_
place you can view this data outside of the Band.

#### Weather

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen will give you a 7-day forecast.

![The weather forecast on the Band](img/weather-band.jpg "The weather forecast on the Band")

In the app, you can configure a few settings along with location.

![The weather screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/weather-app.jpg "The weather screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

I really like this little app. It's an easy way to quickly check the weather,
and the 7-day forecast is handy. I do wish tapping on a day would give a little bit
more detail, but it does not.

#### Run

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen begins tracking a run. I personally
really dislike running (I much prefer biking), so I have this disabled.

In the app, you can change a few settings for this functionality.

![The running screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/run-app.jpg "The running screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

#### Alarm

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen begins shows the list of
active alarms. You _cannot_ set alarms from the Band directly.
I use my phone for alarms, so I have this disabled.

In the app, you can set alarms (strangely, only up to 6).

![The alarm screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/alarms-app.jpg "The alarm screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

#### Shortcuts

The "shortcuts" name is a bit deceptive. It's for custom shortcuts and actions
you can setup for
[_only supported Wyze devices_](https://support.wyzecam.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041403591-Shortcuts).
I assume to turn on/off lights and things.

On the Band itself, I have no idea what this does, as I don't own any other Wyze
smart home products. It probably just lists the shortcuts available.

In the app, you can (presumably) setup these shortcuts.

![The shortcuts screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/shortcuts-app.jpg "The shortcuts screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

#### Notifications

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen begins shows a history of
notifications.

In the app, you can configure which apps you would like to receive notifications from.

![The notifications screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/notifications-app.jpg "The notifications screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

I'm still undecided on this one. Yes, getting notifications on your wrist is nice,
especially for things like phone calls, but it just doesn't work that well.
When I first got the Band, notifications would just fail to show up even though
everything seemed to be setup fine. Updates seem to have fixed this.
Another big issue is that the Band tries to show the content of notifications,
and there is no way to turn this off. With the tiny screen, it can only fit 10
characters across, so things like text messages, and even email subjects
get line-wrapped to hell. I really would love a way to just get the _indication_
that I have an unread message, so I can look at it on my phone. Additionally,
there is no power setting for the vibration of the notification. The vibration
motor in the Band is very strong, and notifications have legitimately startled
me before.

In some positive light, the smart Do No Disturb is really good.
It automatically detects when I'm sleeping and silences notifications. I haven't had
it wake me up with a notification yet while I was asleep.

#### Find

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen will make your phone vibrate.

In the app, you can make the Band vibrate.

![The find device screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/find-device-app.jpg "The find device screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

This is really nifty, and something I would not have thought of. Again, when I first
got the band, this didn't seem to consistently work. I would have the Band and my phone
right next to each other, the Wyze app say they were connected, push the button, and
absolutely nothing happen. Updates seem to have fixed this.

#### Alexa

This is the worst one. Have you ever wanted to talk to Alexa on your wrist,
but with a 3-second delay? Neither have I.

This one isn't a "screen", but instead you press and hold the one button on the thing
for two seconds. Wait for the Band to get ready for two **more** seconds,
then talk at it, and wait for your
response. Oh, and have this thing buzz on your wrist **_five_** separate times.
To be as fair as possible for this test, I rebooted the Band right before recording.

{{< video src="vid/alexa.mp4" alt="Alexa on the Band demonstration" caption="Make sure your audio is on" autoplay="false" >}}

I truly hate it. I have never once activated it on purpose. Did I mention that
you can't turn off the gesture? I have a Google Pixel 3a, with the squeezable sides
to bring up the Google Assistant. I much rather use that than this. With the Band,
you can at least sign out of Alexa, but if you still long press the button (easy to
do on a pillow by accident), the Band will vibrate and prompt you to sign in to
Alexa.

#### Alexa Alerts

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen will show you alerts from Alexa,
if you're into that kind of thing.

In the app, you can setup Alexa.

![The Alexa screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/alexa-app.jpg "The Alexa screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

#### Settings

This is also the only other screen that you cannot remove.

On the Band itself, tapping on this screen will show bring up some power functions
(brightness, shutdown, reboot, reset).

In the app, you can change some Band settings.

![The settings screen on the Band and in the Wyze app](img/settings-app.jpg "The settings screen on the Band and in the Wyze app")

Now, you may naively assume this is where you would find all of your Band settings
in the app. How wrong you are. No, if you want to modify _other_ settings
such as Alexa, device name, or your health info, you have to click the three dots in
the top right which is super not-obvious.

![The additional settings in the Wyze app](img/settings-app-2.jpg "WHY IS THIS NOT WITH THE OTHER SETTINGS?!")

I cannot figure why this is just not with the other Band settings in the Wyze app.
You have to swipe through all these screens to access all these settings, with one of
them called "Settings", but you have to go somewhere else to find the _special_
settings. It really is terrible UX.

### Other Thoughts

With all that out of the way, here are my other gripes and things.

#### Battery Life

The battery life of the Band is really fantastic. I can go a solid 2 weeks
between charges easily. And the charge time is pretty minimal too,
it's something I barely have to think about. Which is great, as I'm used to a Casio
G-Shock watch that goes 5+ years between battery changes.

#### Screen

The screen is also _really_ good (for the price point). It's no Apple Watch retina
display, but for $25, a full-color AMOLED display is darn good value. I personally
think it's better than my mom's FitBit Charge 3 which I believe is also AMOLED,
but only two colors.

Additionally, the brightness is fantastic. I've never had any issues
viewing the Band outside in the sun.

#### Fitness Apps

[You can't share the data from the Band with any other fitness apps at all.](https://support.wyzecam.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041415571-Does-Wyze-Band-work-with-Google-or-other-integrations-)
Nor can you share data from any fitness apps with the Wyze app. So all
your data like steps, heart rate, etc. are all locked into the Wyze app.
While support "is coming", this is a serious bummer. It feels like this was
omitted to meet the release date.

The more baffling thing is that the [Wyze Scale](https://wyze.com/wyze-scale) currently
[_does_ in fact do this](https://support.wyzecam.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039174572-How-do-I-sync-the-Wyze-app-with-Google-Fit-).
It makes absolutely sense to me that one product in Wyze's fitness tracker
lineup supports data sharing while the other doesn't! WHY?! Both were released
at the same time, both should support it.

#### Waterproof

Yes, it's waterproof (up to about 50 meters). No, that doesn't mean you should wear
it while swimming/showering/diving. You see, with the touchscreen, nearly any
water pressure causes the Band to think it was just touched. Which will cause
it to trigger Alexa, which is insanely obnoxious. It makes it completely
unusable underwater. Also, it's real fun in the shower to see the
Band just scrolling through screens and
things being activated while the water is hitting it. So while "waterproof",
I make sure to always take it off while swimming or showering. About the only
thing the waterproof rating is good for is maybe outside in the rain, or accidentally
falling into water.

#### Wyze App

I do admit, I am using the Beta version of the app, but I've had these
issues in the stable version too. The Android Wyze app locks up a lot.
Countless times, the "Wyze app is running in the background" notification is showing,
but the Band doesn't think it's connected. I go to open the Wyze app, and it immediately
closes. I try to open it again, and it immediately closes. I have to force stop the app
before I can finally reopen it.

Additionally, every time you open the app and select the Band,
it syncs. Doesn't matter when you last did it. It's kind of annoying when you last
synced 5 seconds ago, and are just trying out a setting. Is it not syncing in the
background?

For a product that needs the accompanying app to function, the app is buggy and
unstable.

#### Other Bugs

Just in general, things are still a bit buggy. For example, while taking pictures
for this review, my band shows the location as Seattle, despite being in Florida.

![Seattle being displayed on the Band, despite being in Florida](img/bad-weather.jpg "We're not in Florida anymore...")

When I tap on the screen, it correctly shows me the weather for my location in Florida.
Funnily enough, the weather its displaying on the main screen is also the weather
where I am actually, and _not_ Seattle. So I have no idea why that shows Seattle.

### Final Thoughts

Despite all my complaints, the Wyze Band is really good for $25 and a serious
competitor to FitBit. I think a lot of the issues with the product are from it
being rushed to meet a release date, and hopefully can be fixed with software
updates in the future. I recommend it for anyone thinking about it, since it's
just inexpensive, and at least from a reputable manufacturer and not just a Chinese
white-label product.
