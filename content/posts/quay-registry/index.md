## Background

Recently, I've become more interested in Docker containers and registries.
This is from a combination of dealing with these daily at work and publishing my
[own containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/nathanvaughn) publicly. I thought it
would be neat to publish my containers on my own private registry,
on my own domain name. For example,
instead of `docker pull ghcr.io/nathanvaughn/webtrees`
it would be `docker pull cr.nathanv.app/webtrees`.

Part of this is my constant desire to host non-critical services myself
(by critical, I mean like email, calendar, git, etc.), part is a desire to remove
my dependence on Docker Hub (I don't fully trust their ability to stay around forever,
given them locking more features behind paid tiers,
adding more aggressive rate limits, etc.). Additionally, outages are extremely disruptive,
due to how the Docker client works\* and it using `index.docker.io`
as the default registry.

\* Whenever you try to build a Docker image that bases off another image with `FROM`,
Docker will _always_ try to fetch the hash of the tag you have used to see if there's
a newer version available. If Docker can't connect to the registry to check this,
it fails and will refuse to build your image, even if you already have the
base image locally. In my opinion, this is a colossally stupid design decision.
At work, this caused all of our Docker builds to fail because
Docker Hub was down, even though our build agents had the images already pulled.
We quickly made copies of all our base images to our own registry.

## What is a Registry

First off, we need to understand what a Docker registry is. At its core, a registry
is just a web server with some API endpoints that returns and accepts JSON and files.
That's really about it. The full specification for a registry is defined
[here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/). In terms of a web UI
or authentication, that is not handled by the core registry software and is left
to the administrator to provide, if desired. While the "official" registry software is
[here](https://github.com/distribution/distribution), as the specification
is freely available, anyone can implement their own. This means that a barebones Docker
registry is just a bit of software that has no user interface, and anyone can
`docker push` to or `docker pull` from.

## Search

With this in mind, I wanted to run my own registry that had a nice web UI for
public browsing and I could sign in with via
[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) or
[OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect)
(Open ID Connect, _basically_ OAuth)
(the two protocols that [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) provide). In my mind,
this shouldn't be too difficult, as I thought lots of tech companies run their own
internal registries with similar requirements. Oh how wrong I was.

### Serverless Registry Proxy

[Link](https://github.com/ahmetb/serverless-registry-proxy)

When I first casually was interested in hosting container images on my own domain name,
Cloudflare's Argo Tunnel still charged per gigabyte of bandwidth, so I was more
interested in having something hosted for me. Initially, I had looked into using
this in order to serve a registry on my own domain name, but really be hosted elsewhere,
much like how I use GitHub Pages for my homepage and this blog.
However, there are two problems with this software that prevented me from using it.

1. This acts as a reverse-proxy, thus all traffic between the user and the registry
   go through it. When setup as an AWS Lambda Function or other serverless function,
   the bandwidth fees can get quite expensive.
2. The Docker client does not follow redirects. I tried to rewrite this in Python
   to instead serve 301 redirects rather than proxying traffic to save on bandwidth costs,
   but it did not work.

### Amazon ECR Public

![Amazon ECR Public Logo](img/ecr-public-logo.png)

[Link](https://gallery.ecr.aws/)

Next, I started to look into other hosted registries. The first thing I tried was
Amazon Web Service's Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public (what a mouthful).
While free and with generous limits,
the URL scheme is like `public.ecr.aws/<random string>/<container>`
and there's no way to add a custom domain name.
While it seems neat if you are fully-invested in the AWS ecosystem,
this doesn't really provide any advantages over Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.

![Amazon ECR Public Gallery](img/ecr-gallery.png)

### Azure Container Registry

![Azure Container Registry Logo](img/acr-logo.png)

[Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)

I'm most familiar with this and looked into using it for myself.
Unlike most hosted container registries, you get a custom subdomain. So instead of
`azurecr.io/<name>/<container>` you get `<name>.azurecr.io/<container>`.
However, it lacks a public web UI browser, it costs
[$0.16/day](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-registry/)
for the most basic plan (at time of writing), and only
[supports custom domain names](https://github.com/Azure/acr/blob/main/docs/custom-domain/README.md)
with a _Premium_ subscription. This was far too expensive and restrictive
for what I wanted. Cloudflare Argo Tunnel was still a paid product so my
search ended here, for now.

### Harbor

![Harbor Logo](img/harbor-logo.png)

[Link](https://goharbor.io/)

After Cloudflare Tunnel
[was made free](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tunnel-for-everyone/), I began
looking into hosting my own registry on my own hardware.
One of the first self-hosted registry softwares I came across was Harbor by VMWare.
It seemed to have a lot of the features I was looking for. OIDC sign-in and all-in-one
registry and web UI for management. The real problem for this for me was that
they're very adamant that you use their
[installer](https://goharbor.io/docs/latest/install-config/download-installer/).
There's no mention of how to setup a Docker-compose stack (which is how I currently
manage all of my applications). I really want a little bit more DIY setup process
as I want to be able to connect software to my existing databases and reverse proxy.
I do this via a shared Docker network that containers can be connected to. Additionally,
I like to use Docker named volumes as it makes centralized backups easier. There's
no ability to configure any of this in Harbor, nor is it easy to reverse-engineer
as the installer creates a Docker-compose stack and a whole mess of folders and data.
I quickly abandoned this idea as I thought the effort of reverse-engineering this
would not be worthwhile and create an extremely fragile setup.

### Portus

![Portus Logo](img/portus-logo.png)

[Link](https://port.us.org/)

The first piece of software I really tried and spent to time to setup was
Portus by the SUSE team. It seemed really promising. It acts as an authorization server
that can connect to an OIDC provider, and gives a registry management web interface.
It doesn't _really_ have a nice public registry browser, but I was already striking
out so this looked promising. However, this ended up being a massive timesink.
First off, the official website has an invalid SSL certificate (not a good sign)
and the GitHub repository hasn't had a meaningful code contribution in nearly 2 years.
To make it worse, a number of the official Docker images just flat out wouldn't
run for me, with errors indicative that the image was built incorrectly (like `exec.go`
errors that usually arise when you screw up your entrypoint).
Portus requires 2 separate containers to run (a web UI and a background worker)
together but I couldn't even get the same version of both to work
(they're the same container image, just a different entry command).
Even with my cobbled together stack "running" it was extremely buggy and unstable.
As much as I wanted it to work out, it just didn't.

For example, the error log from the background worker when an image was pulled:

```log

This caused it to crash.

### Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3

![Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3 Logo](img/nexus-logo.png)

[Link](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3)

After the failure of Portus, the next software
I tried was Sonatype's Nexus Repository Manager 3 (another mouthful).
This is pretty cool software. It's a universal package repository,
like [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/),
[ProGet](https://inedo.com/proget),
or [Azure Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/artifacts/).
I played with this some, but it had a few downsides. First and foremost,
while self-hosted, only LDAP is supported as a form of single sign-on in
the free version. SAML authentication requires a license. While it does have a web UI
for browsing the registry, it's very basic and pretty bland. This isn't really a
negative against it, but the permissions system is very complex and way
more complicated than what I needed for a single-user deployment, and I struggled
a lot with them. Lastly, the application is also very heavy as it runs an Elasticsearch
instance inside the container among other services. Nice software, but just not what
I was looking for and super overkill for what I was trying to do.

### GitLab Container Registry

![GitLab Logo](img/gitlab-logo.jpg)

[Link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/)

Starting to get desperate, I investigated GitLab's container registry. This is part
of the GitLab application as a whole. I didn't install it, but from reading their
documentation, this seems to be heavily based around the "projects" you have in
GitLab, thus I would need to make mirrors of all of my containers as GitLab projects.
I'm not interested in moving my code to my own GitLab instance, so I decided to shelve
this for now. However, being able to sign-in to my registry with GitLab
(which supports a _ton_ of different connections like LDAP, OIDC, etc.)
was going to be a huge plus.

### Quay

![Quay Logo](img/quay-logo.png)

[Link](https://www.projectquay.io/)

Last, but certainly not least is Quay. Spoiler alert, Quay is what I ended up
going with. I didn't find Quay earlier because when I searched for self-hosted
registry software, Quay would come up, but I thought it meant [Quay.io](https://quay.io)
which is Red Hat's public instance of the Quay software.

![Registry software list](img/registry-software-list.png)

Quay is pretty cool software. It's a self-hosted Docker registry and web UI, and a lot
like Docker Hub. Users can create accounts and have their own namespace, and it
supports lots of different authentication providers. If you want to see what it looks
like, just see [Quay.io](https://quay.io). It's fully free and open-source and
developed by Red Hat. It checked all the boxes I wanted, so I decided to go with it.

## Setup

Now, I'll discuss getting Quay setup (the meat of this article).

### Disclaimer

This is not a fully secure production-ready setup. Quay recommends setup certificates
in the application itself rather than using a reverse-proxy.
Communication between containers should also be secured,
though they are not in this example.
Additionally, using some sort of blob storage is highly recommended
rather than local filesystem storage. Finally, you should pin the versions of
the containers you're using, I'm just showing `latest` as an example.

### Quay

Setting up Quay is a bit different than most Docker-based software. You need
to launch the container one time in a config mode, which allows you to generate a config
file, that you'll then feed to the container.

To do this, launch the container with the command `config <password>`.

```yaml
services:
  config:
    command: config secret
    image: quay.io/projectquay/quay:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - app_config:/conf/stack
```

When you open `<ip>:8080` in your web browser, you'll be prompted to sign in.
Enter the user `quayconfig` and the password you selected.

![Quay config login](img/quay-config-login.png)

Fill out the configuration. Item to note, while Quay supports MySQL, I had issues
setting this up, and found using PostgreSQL to be easier
(and Clair needs PostgreSQL anyways, more on that later). Just make sure to add the
`pg_trgm` extension to the PostgreSQL database you create. Example:

```bash
psql # login
\c quay # switch to desired database
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm; # install extension
```

The options inside the configuration are extensive,
so I'm not going to go over all of them. The full documentation is available
[here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/quay-schema).

An important option is enabling non-superuser creation.
If you have it setup as I do to only allow sign-ins through an external
authentication provider, Quay needs to create an account the first time a user signs in.
You should allow account creation, and restrict sign-ins at your identity provider.
That way as long as someone can sign in with your authentication service, they can
sign in to Quay, and Quay will create an account as needed.

After you finish filling out the configuration, validate the configuration at the bottom
of the page and download the configuration.

![Quay config done](img/quay-config-done.png)

Before you put this config inside the Quay container, there are a few important
options not available in the UI, that you can change manually.

```yaml
# adds gravatar avatars
AVATAR_KIND: gravatar
# this defaults to true, but allows you to omit the
# user/org part of a container namespace, and have it interpreted as "library".
# For example: `quay.io/library/python` will be equivalent to `quay.io/python`.
FEATURE_LIBRARY_SUPPORT: true
# allows users to rename account
FEATURE_USER_RENAME: true
```

Now place this inside the `/conf/stack/` folder of your container.

```bash
# recommended way
sudo docker cp config.yaml quay_config_1:/conf/stack/

# janky way
sudo cp config.yaml /var/lib/docker/volumes/quay_app_config/_data/
```

Relaunch the container without the `config` command, and you're set (it will
probably take a few minutes to start up the first time)!

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: quay.io/projectquay/quay:latest
    ports:
      - 80:8080
      - 443:8443
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - app_storage:/datastorage
      - app_config:/conf/stack
      - app_log:/var/log
      - app_tmp:/tmp

volumes:
  app_storage:
    driver: local
  app_config:
    driver: local
  app_log:
    driver: local
  app_tmp:
    driver: local
  clair_config:
    driver: local
```

If you decided to leave the library support enabled earlier, you'll need to create
and organization or user with this name in order for it to work. Personally,
I recommend
[creating an organization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/use_red_hat_quay/proc-use-quay-create-user-org#proc-use-quay-create-orgs),
and adding your account to it.

### Mirror

So, now that you have Quay setup, you may have a desire to mirror some
public containers to your own registry. Unfortunately, Quay does not support
acting as a [pull-through cache](https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/),
however you can mirror specific containers and tags into your Quay instance.

To enable this, relaunch Quay in configuration mode and enable repository mirroring.
Additionally, make sure you have `FEATURE_RATE_LIMITS` set to `false`. If you have
this enabled, it enforces some strict rate limits (even on itself) that can cause
repository mirroring to fail. Copy the new config back into the container.

Now, you need to start a second container to act as a mirroring worker. This is the
same image as the main container, just run with the `repomirror` command.
Make sure it shares the same volumes/bind mounts as the primary container.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: quay.io/projectquay/quay:latest
    ports:
      - 80:8080
      - 443:8443
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - app_storage:/datastorage
      - app_config:/conf/stack
      - app_log:/var/log
      - app_tmp:/tmp

  mirror:
    command: repomirror
    depends_on:
      - app
    image: quay.io/projectquay/quay:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - app_storage:/datastorage
      - app_config:/conf/stack
      - app_log:/var/log
      - app_tmp:/tmp

volumes:
  app_storage:
    driver: local
  app_config:
    driver: local
  app_log:
    driver: local
  app_tmp:
    driver: local
```

Now you can
[create a mirrored repository](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay#create-mirrored-repo).

⚠ Warning ⚠: I would be extremely careful of starting both the main Quay container and
the mirror worker at the same time. When starting a new setup from scratch, or upgrading
the versions, the first thing Quay does is create/migrate the database schema.
Having two containers do this at the same time will end poorly,
and usually results in a corrupted state.
Start one container, let it migrate the database, then starts the other.

### Clair

Now that Quay is setup with repository mirroring, we can top it off with
vulnerability scanning from Clair. Clair is a static vulnerability analysis tool
for containers, also developed by the Quay team. When combined with Quay, you
can see the vulnerabilities in containers right in the web UI for the registry.
This is pretty sweet, because all the hosted registries I know of charge you
extra for vulnerability scanning, and this is integrated directly into Quay for free.

![List of tags showing vulnerabilities in the Quay interface](img/quay-tags.png "You can see the little pie chart of vulnerabilities for each tag")

Before you get started, Clair has a habit of writing a LOT of data to the log.
I highly recommend modifying your Docker `daemon.json` to limit the size
of the log files. Documentation for that is
[here](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/). Example:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m",
    "max-file": "3"
  }
}
```

I had my `daemon.json` file set to the default (empty) settings. I found out the
hard way that this will allow a single log file to grow infinitely.

![A 270GB log file](img/clair-log.png "It took me forever to figure out why my server was constantly hammering the disk")

To setup Clair, you first need to configure Quay.
Relaunch the Quay configurator and enable
vulnerability scanning. You also want to generate a pre-shared key (PSK).
Copy this value. Save the configuration and copy it back into the container.

For Clair, setup a PostgreSQL database for it, just like Quay. You will need
to manually create a settings file for Clair (much like Quay) and copy it
into `/config` of the Clair container. See [Clair Config](#clair-config) for
my configuration or
[Quay's documentation](https://docs.projectquay.io/manage_quay.html#clair-v4)
for another example. The full reference can be found
[here](https://quay.github.io/clair/reference/config.html). Clair has 3 pieces, the
indexer, matcher, and notifier. The easiest and simplest configuration is to
run all 3 at once in the Clair container. Enable this by setting the `CLAIR_MODE`
environment variable to `combo`. Now, launch the Clair container.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: quay.io/projectquay/quay:latest
    ports:
      - 80:8080
      - 443:8443
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - app_storage:/datastorage
      - app_config:/conf/stack
      - app_log:/var/log
      - app_tmp:/tmp

  mirror:
    depends_on:
      - app
    image: quay.io/projectquay/quay:latest
    command: repomirror
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - app_storage:/datastorage
      - app_config:/conf/stack
      - app_log:/var/log
      - app_tmp:/tmp

  clair:
    depends_on:
      - app
    environment:
      - CLAIR_MODE=combo
      - CLAIR_CONF=/config/config.yaml
    image: quay.io/projectquay/clair:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - clair_config:/config

volumes:
  app_storage:
    driver: local
  app_config:
    driver: local
  app_log:
    driver: local
  app_tmp:
    driver: local
  clair_config:
    driver: local
```

That's it! Assuming you configured everything correctly, Clair will automatically
start scanning images already pushed to Quay and any new images.

![Vulnerabilities for a container image shown in the web UI](img/quay-vulns.png)

If you get any "unable to analyze image" messages in Quay, this likely means
there is a version mismatch between Quay and Clair. I would _highly_ recommend
to use the latest stable version of each, as that should always play nice.
I would verify this works before pushing lots of content to your registry, as the
only way to downgrade Quay is to wipe the database and start over.

In the [Clair documentation](https://quay.github.io/clair/concepts/authentication.html),
they mention Quay integration, but I have not figured this out, so I've stuck
with the pre-shared keys.

Lastly, I'm not sure where the "official" images for Clair are. There are 3 different
repositories on `quay.io` alone that seem semi-official.

- [coreos/clair](https://quay.io/repository/coreos/clair)
- [app-sre/clair](https://quay.io/repository/app-sre/clair)
- [projectquay/clair](https://quay.io/repository/projectquay/clair)

## Conclusion

I'm extremely pleased with how this came out. I basically have my own little Docker Hub
on my domain and my own server. If you want to look at it for yourself, go to
[cr.nathanv.app](https://cr.nathanv.app/search) (yes, I could have bought a short domain
such as `nvcr.me` for this, but I rather use a subdomain of my already-existing short
domain. See my rant on that here:
[Stop Using So Many Domain Names]({{< relref "domain-abuse" >}})).
It's got OIDC authentication, a public web UI, vulnerability scanning, support for the
`library` namespace, all-in-one.
