## Background

As a graduation gift, a friend gave me an IBM Model M keyboard that he snagged
from the university surplus store
(not the [first time]({{< relref "sun-ultra-24-build" >}}) that the surplus
store has made an appearance with vintage tech).

This keyboard is absolutely delightful, and I wanted to make a post outlining
my process of cleaning the board.

## IBM Model M History

First, a history lesson.

The year is 1981. IBM has just released the first IBM Personal Computer.
With each IBM PC came a [buckling spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling_spring)
IBM Model F keyboard. Now, the standard keyboard
layout we know today has not been developed yet. These Model F keyboards,
while well-built and pleasant to type on, had a strange layout (by today's standards).

{{< figure src="img/model-f-wiki.png" alt="1984 IBM Model F" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="1984 IBM Model F" captionPosition="center" >}}

The function keys were in columns on the left side and the numpad had a weird layout
with no addition or division keys. While the IBM PC was revolutionary for its time,
IBM realized it could develop a more ergonomic keyboard, and sought out to improve
their Model F. Hence, in 1984, the IBM Model M was born.

The IBM Model M (also known as the "IBM Enhanced Keyboard") is the grandfather of
all modern keyboards.

{{< figure src="img/model-m-wiki.png" alt="1986 IBM Model M" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="1986 IBM Model M" captionPosition="center" >}}

With what IBM learned from their ergonomics studies in the years
prior, they moved the function keys to be above the number keys, in groups of four.
They also rearranged the numpad, added the arrow keys, and added the six key block
of Insert, Home, Delete, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys. However, they refused
to add the increasingly common "Windows key" to their keyboard, opting to leave a blank
space on either side of the Alt keys instead.

Now, in order to reduce costs from the Model F,
IBM made some compromises with the Model M. Primarily, these were to change the
Model F's design with a capacitive membrane and full
[N-key rollover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-key_rollover), to a
membrane design and losing the N-key rollover support.

The history of the Model M is long and complicated as well over
[100 different variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard#Features_by_part_number)
were produced (different colors, keyboard layouts, design improvements,
connectors, logo style, etc.). The short version is that in 1991, IBM decided
it didn't want to continue manufacturing keyboards, and sold its keyboard business
to Lexmark. Lexmark continuing making Model Ms until 1996 when they stopped production.
After this, a group of ex-Lexmark employees bought the rights
and manufacturing tooling, and formed the company
[Unicomp](https://www.pckeyboard.com/), who continues to manufacture
brand-new Model M's to this day in different colors, with Windows keys, and USB support
(just without the IBM branding).

{{< figure src="img/model-m-unicomp.jpg" alt="A new Unicomp Model M" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="A new Unicomp Model M" captionPosition="center" >}}

Over the years, to decrease manufacturing costs, the Model M's were made cheaper
by using lower quality plastics, and thinner components. This means that generally, the
older a Model M is, the better built it is. This unfortunately means that Unicomp
keyboards, while as close to real thing as you can get new, are based off the molds
and manufacturing at the end of production, resulting in the lowest-quality of
the Model M series.

## My Specific Keyboard

With all that out of the way, let's look at the exact keyboard I have.

{{< figure src="img/birth-certificate.jpg" alt="My IBM Model M's birth certificate" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="My IBM Model M's birth certificate" captionPosition="center" >}}

My Model M is a part number 1390120 and was built on January 14, 1986. There's a few
notable features about this part number compared to most.

{{< figure src="img/tramp-stamp.jpg" alt="My Model M has no lock lights and a square badge" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="My Model M has no lock lights and a square badge" captionPosition="center" >}}

Two of the most notable things are that

1. There are no lock lights
2. It has a square IBM badge

This tells us that the keyboard was one of the original generations produced, as
the square IBM badges were only made for a few years before being replaced
by oval badges. Additionally, the keyboard has no lock lights. This means that it must
have been bundled with a PC or terminal that displayed the lock light status on
the monitor rather than keyboard.

There are two more things that stand out to me. First, is the connector.

{{< figure src="img/sdl-connector.jpg" alt="Removable SDL connector on the keyboard" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Removable SDL connector on the keyboard" captionPosition="center" >}}

This keyboard has a removable
[SDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shielded_data_link_connector) connector. As this
keyboard actually predates the [PS/2 protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port)
by a year, this keyboard likely came with a SDL to
[AT](https://deskthority.net/wiki/AT_keyboard_interface)
(basically a 5-pin DIN connector) cable from the factory.

{{< figure src="img/sdl-cable.jpg" alt="SDL to PS/2 cable given to me" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="SDL to PS/2 cable given to me" captionPosition="center" >}}

However, the keyboard was still compatible with the PS/2 protocol once
it had been developed. While the original cable for the keyboard is long-gone, with
the keyboard itself, I was given a SDL to PS/2 cable that works perfectly fine on modern
motherboards.

{{< figure src="img/relegendable.jpg" alt="Relegendable keycaps" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Relegendable keycaps. Here, I've pulled off the top keycaps with the legends from the arrow keys." captionPosition="center" >}}

Lastly, this keyboard also features relegendable keycaps. The keycap on each key is
actually two pieces. The top piece comes off fairly easily with just your fingers,
while the bottom piece is more firmly attached to the spring of each switch. This
was done to make different localizations of the keyboards easier, as the keyboards
and bottom keycaps could be mass produced, and only a secondary top keycap set
produced for each localization.

## Cleaning

## Review

Here's my thoughts on the keyboard. Mind you, I usually typed on Cherry MX Blues and
Browns prior. I don't have the time or money to be a true keyboard aficionado like
some on [/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards).

{{< figure src="img/reddit-rant.jpg" alt="/u/SolitaryEgg has some strong feeling towards the /r/MechanicalKeyboards community" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="/u/SolitaryEgg has some strong feeling towards the /r/MechanicalKeyboards community" >}}

### Feel

Overall, I like the board a lot. The tactileness of the switches is lovely, though
I usually bottom out keycaps anyways. The switches are far heavier than I was used to
with Blues and at first left my fingers feeling tired after lots of typing.

### Sound

### Issues

There's a few things you have to deal with, with a keyboard this old.
First is the size. This thing is a ***monster***. It's XX mm long by XX mm wide.
It takes up a ton of desk space.

TODO image

Additionally, the lack of Windows key can be problematic. I was able to get
around this by using the program [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys)
and remapping the [Scroll Lock](https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/64709) key
to act as a Windows key as I can't think of a time I've ever
actually needed the key.

Lastly, with my specific keyboard not having any lock lights, knowing numlock
or capslock is on can frustrating. For this, I've found the program
[TrayStatus](https://www.traystatus.com/) works wonderfully for this,
by adding customizable icons in the Windows system tray.
