## Background

I'm currently working on a Flask project and I wanted to combine two packages
([Flask-CDN](https://github.com/paylogic/flask-cdn) and
[Flask-Static-Digest](https://github.com/nickjj/flask-static-digest))
that both modify Flask's `url_for` function.

## Problem

However, these two packages are not made to work together. Flask-CDN overrides the
`url_for` function in the context of templates. Once that function is called,
it applies its processing and then calls Flask's underlying `url_for` function.
Flask-Static-Digest works similarly, but instead defines a new
function `static_url_for`. This function still ends up calling `url_for`.

What I wanted was to have Flask-Static-Digest call the `url_for` function of Flask-CDN
so that I could combine the features of both.

{{< figure src="img/desired-diagram.svg" alt="How I want it to work." caption="How I want it to work."  >}}

I really wanted to avoid editing code of the dependencies if at all possible,
so I tried to see if I could get Flask-Static-Digest to import Flask-CDN while making it
_think_ it was importing Flask.

## Solution

The answer is yes, you can do this, by overwriting `sys.modules`. Here is an example:

### a.py

{{< highlight python >}}
{{< readfile file="posts/faking-python-imports/code/a.py" >}}
{{< / highlight >}}

### b.py

{{< highlight python >}}
{{< readfile file="posts/faking-python-imports/code/b.py" >}}
{{< / highlight >}}

### c.py

{{< highlight python >}}
{{< readfile file="posts/faking-python-imports/code/c.py" >}}
{{< / highlight >}}

### main.py

{{< highlight python >}}
{{< readfile file="posts/faking-python-imports/code/main.py" >}}
{{< / highlight >}}

And after running `main.py`:

```bash
$ > python main.py
A
The real value of c.func is: 25
B
The fake value of c.func is: 30
```

The dictionary `sys.module` contains references to every module you have imported.

```python
Python 3.8.2 (tags/v3.8.2:7b3ab59, Feb 25 2020, 23:03:10) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> import string
>>> sys.modules["string"]
<module 'string' from 'C:\\Python38\\lib\\string.py'>
>>>
```

All you have to do is inject or overwrite your own values. For reference,
here is what I've done in my Flask app:

```python
# static digest
# we need this to call the CDN's url_for and not flask
# don't try this at home, kids
flask_cdn_import = __import__("flask_cdn")
flask_real_import = __import__("flask")

# replace real flask import with fake flask cdn import
sys.modules["flask"] = flask_cdn_import
# import the flask digest module with the fake import
from flask_static_digest import FlaskStaticDigest  # noqa

# put the flask module back to what it was
sys.modules["flask"] = flask_real_import
# run the class init from flask digest
static_digest = FlaskStaticDigest()
```

## Conclusion

While this trick can be very useful, it can also very dangerous and easy to break stuff.
Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
