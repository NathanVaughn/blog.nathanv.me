## Background

While I was
[working at Collins](https://nathanv.me#systemssoftware-engineering-co-op-collins-aerospace)
my roommate unexpectedly left, and gave me his bicycle for free.

After closer inspection, the bike was a 
[1973](https://bikehistory.org/schwinn.php?serial=HJ613361)
Schwinn Varsity 27" 10-speed. It was in pretty rough shape. The front tire didn't hold air,
neither tire had any tread left (if there was any to begin with), and just in general,
the bike looked neglected.

Since I got the bike for the wonderful price of free,
I decided to keep it, and to fix it up. I hadn't owned a bicycle in many years,
and frankly didn't know much about bike maintenance, but I thought this would be
a good project to learn with without investing much money.

## Project Goals

To begin with, I immediately decided that I wanted to simply repair the bike, and not
restore it. The major reasons for this were that I wanted to save money and make the
bike what I wanted. Also, the Varsity line of bicycles from Schwinn aren't exactly
rare or collectible, so I didn't feel bad at all for not restoring it.

## Parts

Here are all the parts that I ended up purchasing for the bike.

### Tubes

I purchased two
[27" Bell Standard Bike Tubes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AAYBI).
While the rear tire held air alright, I decided to just replace both tubes at the same
time since I guessed (correctly) that they were both ancient. I just picked these
since they were inexpensive, highly rated on Amazon, and were Schrader valves.

### Tires

This was probably the biggest decision for the whole bike. I ended up going with two
[Continental Ride Tour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L0WE62E)
tires. The reason for this was that I currently live in Iowa, and we actually have
snow here, so I wanted some tread on the tires. Also, while I could have gotten tires
that more closely matched the original ones with gum walls
(such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/TAC-Two-Pack-27x1-1-Select/dp/B077J86YR2)).
However, to me at least, that rubber just looks more "plastic-y" and lower quality.

Amazon surprised me by not folding or rolling up the tires at all. No, instead, they
shipped the tires in their normal resting shape. I was really surprised by the *massive*
box they left at my door.

### Rim Tape

If you were like me and didn't know what rim tape was, it's just tape that you put
around the rim of the wheel so that the spokes don't puncture the tube.

When I was changing the tires on the bike, I didn't realize I would need this and
my local bike shop was closed, so I subsituted some basic electrical tape from Wal-Mart.

### Handlebar Endcaps

While not very important, I didn't like that the handlebar endcaps on my bike didn't
match. One of them was also broken and had sharp metal. I went on Amazon and got
a [4-pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XG51Z4M) 
of various colors that were easily removable. Buying a single pack on Amazon was
close to the same price, so I decided to get multiple colors so I could pick the one
I liked the most.
