title: Fixing a 1973 Schwinn Bicycle

## Background

While I was
[working at Collins](https://nathanv.me#systemssoftware-engineering-co-op-collins-aerospace)
my roommate unexpectedly left, and gave me his bicycle for free.

{{< figure src="img/old-varsity.jpg" alt="1973 Schwinn Varsity" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The bike how I got it." captionPosition="center" >}}

After closer inspection, the bike was a 27"
[1973](https://bikehistory.org/schwinn.php?serial=HJ613361)
Schwinn Varsity 10-speed. It was in pretty rough shape. The front tire didn't hold air,
neither tire had any tread left (if there was any to begin with), and just in general,
the bike looked neglected.

{{< figure src="img/old-tires.jpg" alt="Old bike tires" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="I'm pretty sure this was the original tire that came with the bike from the factory." captionPosition="center" >}}

Since I got the bike for the wonderful price of free,
I decided to keep it and fix it up. I hadn't owned a bicycle in many years
and frankly didn't know much about bike maintenance, but I thought this would be
a good project to learn with without investing too much money.

## Project Goals

To begin with, I immediately decided that I wanted to simply repair the bike and not
restore it. The major reasons for this were that I wanted to save money and make the
bike what I wanted. Also, the Varsity line of bicycles from Schwinn aren't exactly
rare or collectible, so I didn't feel bad at all for not restoring it.

## Parts

Here are all the parts that I ended up purchasing for the bike.

### Tubes

I purchased two
[27" Bell Standard Bike Tubes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AAYBI).
While the rear tire held air alright, I decided to just replace both tubes at the same
time since I guessed (correctly) that they were both ancient. I just picked these
since they were inexpensive, highly rated on Amazon, and were Schrader valves.

{{< figure src="img/bell-tube.jpg" alt="27in Bell standard bike tubes" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Yup. That's a bike tube..." captionPosition="center" >}}

### Tires

This was probably the biggest decision for the whole bike. I ended up going with two
[Continental Ride Tour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L0WE62E)
tires. The reason for this was that I currently live in Iowa, and we actually have
snow here, so I wanted some tread on the tires. Also, while I could have gotten tires
that more closely matched the original ones with gum walls
(such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/TAC-Two-Pack-27x1-1-Select/dp/B077J86YR2)),
I decided not to. To me at least, that rubber just looks more
"plastic-y" and not as good quality.

{{< figure src="img/continental-tire.png" alt="Continental Ride Tour Tire" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Continental Ride Tour tire" captionPosition="center" >}}

Amazon surprised me by not folding or rolling up the tires at all. No, instead, they
shipped the tires in their normal resting shape. I was really surprised by the *massive*
box they left at my door.

{{< figure src="img/big-tire-box.jpg" alt="Large tire box" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="This is the box they arrived in." captionPosition="center" >}}

### Rim Tape

If you were like me and didn't know what rim tape was, it's just tape that you put
around the rim of the wheel so that the spokes don't puncture the tube.

{{< figure src="img/rim-tape-example.jpg" alt="Rim tape example" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Rim tape example (from [parktool.com](parktool.com))" captionPosition="center" >}}

When I was changing the tires on the bike, I didn't realize I would need this and
my local bike shop was closed, so I substituted some basic electrical tape from Walmart.

### Handlebar Endcaps

While not very important, I didn't like that the handlebar endcaps on my bike didn't
match. One of them was also broken and had sharp metal. I went on Amazon and got
a [4-pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XG51Z4M) 
of various colors that were easily removable. Buying a single pack on Amazon was
close to the same price, so I decided to get multiple colors so I could pick the one
I liked the most.

{{< figure src="img/handlebar-endcaps.png" alt="New handlebar endcaps" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="New handlebar endcaps" captionPosition="center" >}}

### Brake Pads

The brakes were old, so I got some new ones at Walmart.

{{< figure src="img/bell-brake-pads.png" alt="Bell brake pads" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Just some Bell brand brake pads" captionPosition="center" >}}

### Shifter Cable

I ended up needing to buy a new shifter cable. I just went to my local bike shop
and got a single one for like $5.

### Handlebar Tape

The old handlebar grip tape appeared to be original. However with the age, there
wasn't much grip left of the "grip" tape. It was more like a hard plastic at this point.
You can really tell by the shininess in this picture.

{{< figure src="img/old-handlebar-tape.jpg" alt="Old handlebar tape" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The old handlebar grip tape more closely resembled a hard plastic shell." captionPosition="center" >}}

There were a number of tears in the tape as well.
I went to my local bike shop (again) and got some new orange grip tape that actually
matches really closely to the original. I also paid the shop to put it on for me
because I didn't trust my own abilities to wrap it well.

{{< figure src="img/new-grip-tape.png" alt="Orange grip tape" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="I'm pretty sure this is what I bought at my bike shop." captionPosition="center" >}}

### Water Bottle Cage

Lastly, I want to take this bike on some longer rides, so I got a basic 
water bottle cage.

{{< figure src="img/water-bottle-cage.png" alt="Water bottle cage" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="A water bottle cage pretty similar to what I purchased." captionPosition="center" >}}

While the water bottle cage I got is a very bright red and the bike is more of an 
orange-red, it looks close enough.

## Tools

### WD-40

{{< video src="vid/hank-hill-wd40.mp4" alt="Hank Hill WD-40" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

### Chain Lube

I just went to Walmart and grabbed whatever they had.

{{< figure src="img/chain-lube.png" alt="Chain lube" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The lightning bolt makes it go faster." captionPosition="center" >}}

### Tire Levers

I had never heard of these things before. In case you're like me and 
don't know what they are, they're basically little pry bars that help you 
put a bike tire on a rim.

{{< figure src="img/tire-lever-usage.jpg" alt="Tire lever usage" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="This is how you're supposed to use a tire lever." captionPosition="center" >}}

I bought a [4-pack on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FDS3VCW/).

{{< figure src="img/tire-levers.png" alt="Tire levers" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="You might be beginning to realize that I like the color red." captionPosition="center" >}}

### Crescent Wrenches

I went to a hardware store and got two really basic Craftsman adjustable
crescent wrenches. Nothing special about these at all.

### Wire Brush

I also got a basic metal wire brush during my Walmart run to help clean off gunk.

{{< figure src="img/wire-brush.png" alt="Wire brush" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Generic wire brush" captionPosition="center" >}}

### Air Pump

Lastly, while at Walmart I got a Bell air pump.

{{< figure src="img/bell-air-pump.png" alt="Bell air pump" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="I bought an air pump that's something like this." captionPosition="center" >}}

## Process

### First Work

Well, to start, one of my friends was very kind and let me borrow his living room
to work on the bike.

{{< figure src="img/bike-living-room.jpg" alt="My bicycle being worked on in a living room" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="First time working on the bike in my friend's living room." captionPosition="center" >}}

With a bit of percussive maintenance, we got both the wheels off. Once the wheels were
off, it was more obvious how bad of shape the tires were in. While taking the tires
off the rims, you could hear the rubber cracking. 

Also during this process,
we discovered that the rim tape on the front rim was completely falling off.
As mentioned above, I got some electrical tape and just wrapped it around twice and
cut a hole for the tube stem. It's worked fine so far. The rim tape on the rear wheel
wouldn't come off easily while I was going to replace that as well, so I decided to
just leave it on.

After replacing the tubes and tires, we changed out the brake pads and handlebar
endcaps. The endcaps ended up being a bit a tricky as one of the
existing ones did not have a screw and was just press-fit.
It took quite a bit of patience and prying to get it out.

Lastly, we tried to clean the bike as much as reasonably possible and 
lube everything up.

{{< figure src="img/dirty-bike.jpg" alt="Dirty bicycle" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="This was <i>after</i> trying to clean it." captionPosition="center" >}}

During this whole ordeal, we discovered that the frame of the bike is
more than likely bent. When we first re-attached the rear wheel in a normal
position, it was rubbing against the frame really badly on the front left of the tire.
We ended up having to move the left side of the wheel pretty far forward in its slot
and just tightening it down really hard in order to get it roll straight.

{{< figure src="img/rear-wheel-alignment.jpg" alt="Rear wheel alignment" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="I added the two blue lines to show that the wheel is not centered between the rear two forks. You can also tell by how the brake assembly is tilted a bit to the left." captionPosition="center" >}}

{{< figure src="img/rear-tire-rubbing.jpg" alt="Rear tire rubbing" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="It was hard to get my camera in a position to show it well, but you can kind of see where the tire was rubbing on the frame closest to the camera in the past." captionPosition="center" >}}

{{< figure src="img/rear-wheel-mount.jpg" alt="Rear wheel mount" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="In order to get the wheel to track straight, we had to bring the left side very far forward. A few ugga duggas were used to keep it nice and snug. I swear there is some material holding it on." captionPosition="center" >}}

### More Work

After reassembling the bike and taking it home, I quickly realized that the rear shifter 
wouldn't shift worth a damn (I also taught myself to use the shifter.
There's no dials to spin like I'm used to on mountain bikes,
but levers you pull to manually move the chain between gears. You just listen and feel
for the right spot).
The bike has 2 gears in the front and 5 in the back.
While the front shifter worked alright, the rear required a truly ridiculous amount of
strength to shift more than one gear. I had never worked on a bicycle
derailleur before, but after putting on my engineer's thinking cap and looking at it
and playing with for about 10 minutes, I realized the problem. The cable was far too
loose. So, I pulled out my pliers, loosened the screw at the end of the cable, and
gave it a good yank to tighten it up. Or so I tried to. It was frayed at the end
and wouldn't budge.

{{< figure src="img/rear-cable-frayed.jpg" alt="Rear shifter cable frayed" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="You can see at the bottom that it was frayed pretty bad." captionPosition="center" >}}

So I bought a new cable and figured out how to install it. The old cable was a tough
bastard that didn't want to come out without a fight.

{{< figure src="img/rear-cable-removal.jpg" alt="Rear shifter cable removal" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="It went out swinging." captionPosition="center" >}}

After cursing myself for not cutting the old cable into small chunks to remove, I got
the cable installed and tightened. After some adjustment, it fixed all of my shifting
problems.

At this point, the bike was working pretty well.

{{< figure src="img/fun-in-less-sun.jpg" alt="Bike in the sun" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="I was starting to ride the bike to class now." captionPosition="center" >}}

### Final Work

I decided to also get the grip tape changed
and add a water bottle holder for the sake of longer rides in the future.

{{< figure src="img/new-handlebar-tape.jpg" alt="New handlebar tape" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The new handlebar tape matches really closely and the bike shop did a great job wrapping it." captionPosition="center" >}}

When I bought the water bottle cage, I totally forgot that mountain bikes have holes
you normally screw it into. My road bike had no such holes so I had to get creative.

{{< figure src="img/water-bottle-cage-mounted.jpg" alt="Water bottle cage mounted" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Two hose clamps slipped under the shifting lines hold it nice and snug." captionPosition="center" >}}

Now, I know what you're thinking: "Won't that damage the paint?". Yes, yes it will, 
unless I put some electrical tape underneath of it. However, the paint is already so
beat and rusted that I truly don't care.

Finally, for the sake of safety when I ride at night,
I got some little silicon rechargeable LED lights
that wrap around the handlebars and frame.

{{< figure src="img/schwinn-lights.png" alt="Schwinn lights" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The Schwinn brand lights I got at Walmart." captionPosition="center" >}}

I like them a lot. They've got three modes: solid bright, solid dim, and blinking dim.
They recharge via MicroUSB and they come on and off super quick, so I take them off
whenever I park the bike so they don't get stolen.

{{< figure src="img/night-lights.jpg" alt="Night lights" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="I think it looks pretty good at night." captionPosition="center" >}}

Yes, I'm aware that the rear light is basically pointing straight at the tire.
I'm working on 3D printing parts to replace the existing reflectors with
mounts I can put these lights on instead.

## Result

{{< figure src="img/fun-in-the-sun.jpg" alt="Final result" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="It looks really bright orange in the sun." captionPosition="center" >}}

I think the bike looks pretty good in it's own special patina way.

{{< figure src="img/schwinn-badge.jpg" alt="Schwinn badge" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The front Schwinn badge is in surprisingly good shape." captionPosition="center" >}}

{{< figure src="img/rusty-paint.jpg" alt="Rusty paint" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The Schwinn logo on the side isn't doing so well, though." captionPosition="center" >}}

I don't have any plans to repaint the bike. For starters, spending the time and money
to properly disassemble the whole thing, strip all the paint, clean off the rust,
and repaint it would exceed the value of the bike itself. Also, why would I put in
the effort for such a low-end crapped out bike anyways? Lastly, with the bike not
looking particularly great, it lowers the chance of it getting stolen while on campus.

## Future Work

### Further Disassembly

This summer I'll have more time and tools to work on the bike, so I'd like to
disassemble some more of the bearings and brake assembly to clean them and
give them a good lube.
I will have a power washer available, so I'd really like to use that clean a lot 
of the gunk off.

### Painting Over Phone Number

A previous owner was so kind as to scratch their phone number into the frame of the 
bike. To make it even better, they started on the side, then decided against it
and started over on the top.

{{< figure src="img/old-phone-number.jpg" alt="Rusty paint" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The phone number is 11 digits???" captionPosition="center" >}}

I want to get a file and a bit of close-enough spray paint to cover it.

## Conclusion

Getting two adjustable crescent wrenches was a very smart move. Firstly, for getting
two as that way myself and a friend can work simultaneously. I bought two
because I thought the wheels were going to be stubborn to get off and require me
to brace the other side, but that ended up not being an issue. Second, getting
adjustable wrenches (and not just a set) was a stroke of genius. For some reason,
a lot of the bolts and nuts on the bike aren't quite the same width on every side,
requiring me to constantly adjust the size of the wrench a little bit. I don't
think a set of fixed size wrenches would have worked at all.

Additionally, buying four tire levers was also really smart. Again, this was because
a friend and I could both easily work together. I was just going with the
Amazon's choice and they happened to come in a pack of four.

I'm really thrilled with how the bike has turned out. I probably spent around
~$150-$200 on this at the end of it all. Could I have gotten a better bike from
craigslist or a pawn shop for what I'm using it for, for less?
Almost certainly. However, it was a fun project that I'm proud of and I got to learn
a lot about bicycles and bike maintenance during it. It may look ugly as sin,
but it's mechanically pretty sound and I have the satisfaction of having done almost all
of the work on it myself.
