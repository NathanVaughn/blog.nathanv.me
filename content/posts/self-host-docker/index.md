title: Self-Hosting with Docker and Argo Tunnel
---

## Background

For the past few years, I've rented a VPS to host some web apps for myself. I've done
this since I've lived in college apartments behind a NAT and I wanted to be able
to access these services from the outside world. Also, running locally, I wouldn't
be able to setup HTTPS other than self-signed certs. Yuck.

However, with Cloudflare's new service,
[Argo Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-tunnel/),
and ~~poor financial decisions~~ a server I bought on Craigslist,
I decided to move my apps to be hosted on-premise.

{{< figure src="img/hp_dl_360_g5.jpg" alt="HP DL360 G5 with dual Xeon E5410s and 64GB of RAM" caption="HP DL360 G5 with dual Xeon E5410s and 64GB of RAM"  >}}

## Decision to Use Docker

Previously, my $5/month Linode VPS only had 1GB of RAM, so memory was at a premium.
Because of this, I exclusively used applications built on a LAMP stack
so they could share each other's stack.
While this did help with memory, security wasn't great, and incompatibilities
between things like MySQL and PHP versions made life difficult. This is also
significantly limited what apps I could use for myself.

Now that I have a server with more memory than I know what to do with, I wanted to
try out some virtualization technologies. I figured if the experiment went well,
I would move all my applications to my server. I decided to try out Docker and
containerization first since that's all the rage now. If Docker didn't
work out, I would try traditional VMs with VSphere, ESXi, Proxmox, or something.

## What Are Containers

Docker containers behave a lot like Virtual Machines (VMs). However, under-the-hood,
they're completely different. Instead of running a full-blown operating system,
they actually share the host's kernel, and run off of that. The processes inside a
container are actually processes under the host OS. However, to the processes in the
container, it's like they are in their own OS. The filesystem is sandboxed
from the host (unless you decide to provide access to specific directories)
and containers even get their own network interface. Compared to VMs, containers
have a **much** lower memory footprint, and are super fast to start. Neat!

## Docker Setup

After choosing to try out containers with Docker,
I quickly decided upon using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) rather
than standard Docker. As far as I can tell, Docker Compose and Docker will let you
do the same things, but Docker Compose allows you to create defined `.yml` files
to run multi-container applications. To me, it seems like the difference is really just
defining your configuration in a file rather than the command line.

Instead of this:

```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --log-opt max-size=10m \
  -v freshrss-data:/var/www/FreshRSS/data \
  -e CRON_MIN=4,34 \
  -e TZ=Europe/Paris \
  --label traefik.port=80 \
  --label traefik.frontend.rule=Host:freshrss.example.net \
  --label traefik.frontend.headers.forceSTSHeader=true \
  --label traefik.frontend.headers.STSSeconds=31536000 \
  --name freshrss freshrss/freshrss
```

You have this:

```docker
version: '3'
services:
  freshrss:
    container_name: freshrss
    image: freshrss/freshrss
    environment:
      - CRON_MIN=4,34
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
    volumes:
      - 'freshrss-data:/var/www/FreshRSS/data'
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - traefik.port=80
      - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:freshrss.example.net
      - traefik.frontend.headers.forceSTSHeader=true
      - traefik.frontend.headers.STSSeconds=31536000
```

Working off some examples, I made a Docker Compose file for each
of my applications, each in their own folder. For security, I have every app restricted
to their own network (which Docker Compose will do by default).

```txt
~/dockerfiles
│
└───app1
│   │   docker-compose.yml
│
└───app2
│   │   docker-compose.yml
│   │   .env
│
...
```

For applications that need it, I also opted to create an environment file which contains
secrets like the MySQL account password, rather putting secrets in the actual config
files which are tracked by Git. This is easily done with the `env_file`
parameter in the `docker-compose.yml` file. I go into this more below.

```docker
env_file:
  - ./.env
```

In order to start or stop them all quickly, I wrote a small Python script which will
`sudo docker-compose up -d` or `sudo docker-compose down` all the
various Compose stacks.

## Networking

This is where the real key is. Since my server lives behind a university firewall,
and I want to access applications running on it from the outside world, I need
to use some sort of tunnel.
I opted to use Cloudflare's new service, Argo Tunnel to accomplish this. Basically,
you install the command-line client on your server. You connect it to your locally
running application, it automatically creates a persistent tunnel into Cloudflare's
network, and creates the appropriate DNS record for your domain. Argo Tunnel is included
free with [Argo](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/) which is
$5/month/domain. It's also $0.10/GB of bandwidth after the first gigabyte per month.
The only limit is a hard cap of 1000 tunnels per account.
So far so good.

However, Cloudflare's [official instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/reference/docker/)
of how to use Argo Tunnel with Docker containers kind of suck and is very manual. No good.
I initially tried to use an [nginx reverse proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy)
and have a single tunnel coming out of the Docker host, but wasn't able to get it to work.
Then, I came across [Hera](https://github.com/aschzero/hera).

Hera is a Docker container which automatically monitors your containers and creates
tunnels based on two labels you apply to your containers. This was perfect!
Every application could have it's own tunnel independent of each other and it was
completely automated. The only two labels you need to apply to each container
is the desired hostname and the port the service runs on **inside the container**.

To make this work, I put all the containers that had a web server into a shared
network with the Hera container. I kept web servers and database servers in a stack
sharing their own private network like before. As I didn't really want to create one
**mega** `docker-compose.yml` file, I have the Hera container create the network,
then all the web servers reference it as an external network.

Hera `docker-compose.yml`:

```docker
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    image: 'aschzero/hera:latest'
    networks:
      - tunnel
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock'
      - '/home/nathan/certs:/certs'

networks:
  tunnel:
```

Sample application `docker-compose.yml`:

```docker
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    depends_on:
      - db
    image: 'app/app:latest'
    labels:
      hera.hostname: app.example.com
      hera.port: '80'
    networks:
      - default
      - hera_tunnel
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:1001:80'
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - 'app_data:/var/www/'

  db:
    image: 'mysql:latest'
    networks:
      - default
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - 'db_data:/var/lib/mysql'

networks:
  default:
    internal: true
  hera_tunnel:
    external: true

volumes:
  app_data:
    driver: local
  db_data:
    driver: local
```

The port being exposed to the host (`1001` in the example above) isn't important
as Hera only cares about the port **inside** the container. It just needs to be unique
as you can't have duplicates. I simply started at 1000 and started counting up.

Yes, I could probably also just run a container with the `cloudflared` daemon as part of
each stack, but I didn't see a regularly updated image available.

### Note About Domains

Cloudflare Argo is billed per **domain**. This means without doubling your monthly cost,
you can't create tunnels for two domains. I have a short domain I like to use for
image hosting and link shortening, so this sucked. However, I figured out a simple
workaround. Simply create the tunnel on your main domain to whatever subdomain you
want, then just `CNAME` your second domain to the tunnel subdomain.

Example:

```txt
Link Shortener (app) -> linkshortener.example.com (Tunnel) -> xmpl.com  (CNAME DNS)
```

## Security

Now that I have my applications accessible from the outside world, I would like to
secure them more than their built-in login forms. Niche software developed by amateur
programmers isn't always the most secure. For this, I opted to go with
[Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-access/). This
is a pretty cool service. Basically, this allows you to add authentication via
a multitude of providers, in front of any application you have using Cloudflare DNS,
with extremely granular control. The great thing is that it's free for up to
5 users/month, even for the Premium offering. Yes, this does create a single point
of failure for all of my applications, but Cloudflare outages are pretty rare and
minimal.

Using Cloudflare Access, I've basically whitelisted all my services to only be able
to be accessed by my Google Account. However, many applications have their own
API routes with their own authentication, and can't handle Cloudflare Access
in front of it, so I have to create bypass rules for those.

Lastly, I bind the host port of each container to only the host so that it can't
be accessed even from the local network (my only exception to this right now is
Nextcloud while I sync a bunch of data the first time to avoid paying for Argo
bandwidth).

```docker
ports:
    - '127.0.0.1:1001:80'
```

## Useful Tools

### Portainer

[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) is an absolutely incredible tool for
managing Docker. You can easily view container logs,
launch a console connected to a container, start and stop containers,
manage volumes and networks, and more all from a web interface. It makes interacting
with Docker so much easier.

{{< figure src="img/portainer.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Portainer interface" caption="Screenshot of Portainer interface"  >}}

### Netdata

While not specifically Docker-related, I recently found out about
[Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/). Netdata is an all-in-one performance monitoring
tool for Linux servers. While similar to Grafana + Prometheus, the appeal is that
everything is configured out-of-the-box.
It's a really beautiful interface with a **ton** of statistics available. While not
particularly customizable, the amount of information is immense, and it integrates
well with Docker so you can see which container specifically is hogging all your
CPU.

## Backups

One of the most important parts of any hosting operation is backups. I backup the data
and configurations I use for Docker in 3 places.

### Docker Compose files

The Docker Compose files I've built are stored in a private Git repository on
my GitHub account.

### Docker Secrets

All of my secrets (MySQL passwords, SMTP login, etc.) are stored as secure notes
in my [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/f?14012062) account.

### Data

Every night, I have setup an instance of [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/)
to backup the entire contents of `/var/lib/docker/volumes` to a
[Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) bucket,
and email me a report.
While I probably _should_ stop all containers before doing this, in a low
usage-scenario like mine, I've never had any issues. I chose to use Backblaze B2
versus AWS S3 or Google Cloud because I've been a big fan of their
service for a long time, and their pricing is really good
($0.005/GB/month with the first 10GB free).

## Automation

As much as I love tinkering with things, I do like making the machines work for me.

### Docker Container Updates

Every night, an instance of [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower)
runs and updates any container which has a new image version available.
While probably not the best for a true production environment,
as this is just for myself, I don't mind living life dangerously.

### Host OS Updates

I setup both `apticron` and `unattended-upgrades` on the Ubuntu Server host
so that I get emails about available package updates, and automatic security
update reports.

### Automated Backups

As mentioned above, a Duplicati container creates a backup every night and emails
a report.

### Things I'm Happy With

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with how everything turned out. I understand all the
hype of containers now. Containers make it so easy to quickly run applications
in a consistent way in a pseudo virtual machine. I've really come to love them just for
trying things out. Instead of launching a new VM just to try to
[remember the proper flags for a `tar` command](https://xkcd.com/1168/), I can quickly
launch a disposable Ubuntu container and be immediately dumped into a shell.

```docker
sudo docker run -it ubuntu
```

All in all, my applications now are running on my server in my apartment while being securely
accessible from the outside world, while costing nearly the same as before. Everything
is automatically updated along with nightly off-site backups with email reports.

### Things I'm Not Happy With

#### Docker MySQL

With hosting all my apps on the same stack in the past, they all shared the same
MySQL server. Now, with Docker, every application has its own MySQL server, as there
is no easy way to have multiple databases and users created automatically with the
MySQL Docker image without creating some special bash scripts.
This just seems strange to me, as SQL servers are meant to
handle multiple databases, and running a bunch of extra instances is a lot of
unnecessary memory overhead.

#### Docker Secrets

I feel like Docker doesn't really have a _great_ way to manage secrets. Right now, you can
[create secrets with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/),
but they are only made available to containers via files and are only
available for Docker Swarms.
This sucks, because nearly every container uses environment variables to handle secrets.
Unless you add some shims to your Dockerfiles to support loading values from
files into environment variables, you're out of luck. This essentially forces you
to either pass them on the command-line, or put them into environment files.

#### Argo Pricing

Cloudflare Argo charges $0.10/GB after the first gigabyte of data. This means I
have be **very** careful in what I upload/download from my server via the tunnels,
especially with bandwidth heavy stuff like Nextcloud. Unfortunately, really
solving this problem would require me to use a different service
which charges differently, or hosting my own solution, which I talk about more below.

### Future Work

The biggest limitation that bothers me is that Argo Tunnel only works for HTTP traffic.
This means that I can't run any sort of game servers that work over TCP traffic
without using a service like [Serveo](https://serveo.net) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
on an ad-hoc basis. I could use a `f1-micro` instance in the free-tier of
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free/) to run
a server with Serveo or [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) or something.
However, I really like how well Argo Tunnel <i>Just Works</i>™ with Hera. I could
also potentially restructure everything with a Traefik reverse-proxy on the Docker
host, and then use an ngrok tunnel for the same price, as ngrok allows
tunneling TCP traffic, and doesn't charge based on bandwidth usage.
However, I have more faith in Cloudflare as a significantly larger company with a
long history.
