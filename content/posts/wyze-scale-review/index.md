## Introduction

A few months ago I decided to preorder a [Wyze Scale](https://wyze.com/wyze-scale).
It was only $20 and I was curious to have a "smart" scale so I could track
my weight. This is review is going to be *way* shorter than my
[Wyze Band Review]({{< relref "wyze-band-review" >}}), as it's a far simpler product

Here's the summary:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I give it 5/5 stars, because it does what it says on the tin.

### The Good
---

- Cheap
- Comes with batteries
- Google Fit/Apple Health integration
- Supports multiple users
- Does what it says

### The Bad
---

- My unit makes a very faint, but noticeable high-pitched whine while measuring your weight
- Measuring weight does take a few seconds

### The Ugly
---

None

## Detailed Review

There's not much to this. It came well packaged in a box not too much larger
than itself. It comes with 4 AAA batteries (a very nice inclusion).

Setting it up with the Wyze app was straight forward. You setup users for it in the
app. These users aren't tied to any online accounts. You put in height, birth year,
and gender and that's about it. You step on the scale, it wakes up out of a sleep mode,
records your weight, and will sync it with your phone if it's within Bluetooth range
(which is impressively far). It also can record your heart rate which is a little
strange.

It syncs with Google Fit, as promised. Firmware updates are nice and easy.
My only real complaint is that whenever the scale is measuring my weight,
it makes a very faint high-pitched whine. As soon as it finishes, it stops.
It's hardly noticeable, but when it finishes measuring weight, you notice the room
suddenly just got a little bit quieter.

### Final Thoughts

That's about it. It does what it says, and works as intended. It's really cheap,
and syncs with common health apps. It's a great bang for buck if you're interested
in weight tracking.
